   iii. A child component is a reusable piece of UI  that can access data(props) from it's parent component.
   iv.  Props are readOnly. they are used to pass data from parent to child in a unidirectional way.
state:
   i.  state refers to the data that is managed within a component and can change over time.
   ii. state is used to managed the internal data  and dynamic behaviour of a component.
