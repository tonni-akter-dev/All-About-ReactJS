1.Why immutability is important ?
-->
2.Props vs State ?
-->
props:
    i.   props is a way to pass data from parent to child components.
   ii.  A parent component can pass data to it's child components.
   iii. A child component is a reusable piece of UI  that can access data(props) from it's parent component.
   iv.  Props are readOnly. they are used to pass data from parent to child in a unidirectional way.
state:
   i.  state refers to the data that is managed within a component and can change over time.
   ii. state is used to managed the internal data  and dynamic behaviour of a component.

3.Default vs named exports 
--> A file can have no more than one default export, but it can have as many named exports as you like.When you write a default import, you can put any name you want after import. For example, you could write [import Banana from './Button.js'] instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. Thatâ€™s why they are called named imports!

4.what is JSX?
--> JSX is a syntax extension for javascript. JSX allows you to write html code into your js file.This allows you to insert dynamic content into your UI:
5.what is pure function?
--> pure function is a function with the following characteristics:

i. It minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
ii. Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.
